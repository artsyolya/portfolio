			<h1>Know When to Book Flights App</h1>

					<h2>Project Type</h2>
					<p>Android App Development, UX/UI, Kotlin, XML</p>
				</div>
				<div class="w3-twothird margin-top-25">
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this project was to create an android mobile application that would make it easier for users to know when to book flights for best deals. The Know When to Book Flights app allows the user to find out how far ahead a flight should be booked, as well as the cheapest and most expensive months to visit the selected destinations. Additional features include the ability to explore chosen destinations on Google Maps and Lonely Planet, and book a flight through Skyscanner.</p>
					<p>The app is operational, but hasn’t been launched yet to the public.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="section-divider"></div>

			<!-- Background Section -->
			<h2 class="section-line">Background</h2>
			<div class="single-row">
				<p>The idea for the app came from my own experiences trying to plan trips with a budget in mind. Based on what I had found in the past, there didn’t appear to be an easy way to know how to find good deals for flights at the time. The main options (as far as I could tell) were to:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Sign-up for services like Skyscanner where you can set-up a flight tracker for your intended trip dates and get notified about price changes</li>
					<li>Sign-up for travel agent-like services and pay them to tell you when good price deals come up</li>
					<li>Scour the internet to find the information on individual blog posts</li>
				</ol>

				<p>I wanted to find a way to make the process easier. The idea was take that third option of finding deals and putting the information for different places found on individual blog posts or articles into one app helping budget travelers cut down on the time needed for travel planning.</p>
				<p class="note-txt">Side note: Skyscanner has indeed come out with features similar to this app since the app’s conceptualization and development.</p>

			<!-- Research and App Structure Section -->
			<h2 class="section-line">Research and App Structure</h2>
			<div class="row-grid-twothird">
				<div class="one-third-cell">
					<p>Once the idea for the app was established, I went on to conduct research by scouring the web for those individual blog posts and articles. The information gathered was put into a preliminary dataset in Excel, which later was converted into a database used to pull the data and populate the app’s user interface based on the destination the user would select.</p>
					<p>Through my research, I was able to determine what data to include and how to structure the app.

			<!-- Wireframes Section -->
			<h2 class="section-line">Wireframes</h2>
			<div class="row-grid-twothird">
				<div class="one-third-cell">
					<p>The next step was to develop wireframes for the individual app activity screens. I chose to keep the layout fairly simple.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="two-third-cell">

			<!-- Final Mockup and Development Section -->
			<h2 class="section-line">Final Mockup and Development</h2>
			<div class="row-grid-twothird">
				<div class="one-third-cell">
					<p>For the final mockup of the design layout, I added the colors, images and information for one of the destinations to demonstrate the app’s UI. How the user can interact with the app can also be seen on the right  through the line connections between activity screens.
					</p>
					<p>From there, I went on to develop the actual app using Android Studio. The app was programmed in Kotlin and XML.</p>
					<p>The final step was testing the app in Android Studio and on an android cell phone.</p>
