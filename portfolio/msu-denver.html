					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>I worked at MSU Denver for over two years as a media relations assistant and photographer in the Strategy, Marketing and Communications department. During which time I was involved in various projects, some which I will showcase here. My notable projects that I would like to showcase here included developing content for their Experts Guide website and social media, writing promotional articles, and capturing many events and people on camera for marketing campaigns and editorials. </p>

			<!-- Content Development Section -->
			<h2 class="section-line">Content Development</h2>
			<div class="row-grid-twothird">
				<div class="one-third-cell">
					<p>I wrote and developed a lot of content for the university during my time there.</p>
					<p>A lot of the content development involved working within a web development system called TerminalFour improving the content of the Experts Guide website. The work included updating or editing the majority of the individual expert profiles, and developing countless new profiles, so that the media relations team can better market university’s experts to local media.</p>
					<p>The other type of content development I was involved in was on the social media side. I worked with the social media team to develop strategic Instagram posts that helped boost user engagement, connect with their students, and helped grow the university’s brand identity.</p>

								to be as drastic and unpredictable as ever and so was the task at hand...
